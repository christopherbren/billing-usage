## How many apps can I build?
{: #howmanyapps}

In a Lite account, your apps can access up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you use the available Lite account allowance. If you need more memory, upgrade to a billable account to get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory and pay only for what you use past that. There are no limits to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.

## What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?
{: #monthlyquota}

Reaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.



## What can I order with my Subscription account? 
{: #subs-order}

You can order platform and infrastructure offerings from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.

## How do I qualify for a discount on a Subscription account? 
{: #subs-discount}

To qualify for a pricing discount, you must commit to a combined spending and term commitment of $100.00 USD each month for 12 months. 

## Is there a monthly minimum amount required for Subscription accounts? 
{: #subs-minimum}

Yes, you must spend a minimum of $100.00 USD each month.

## What am I charged if I go over the total amount of my Subscription?
{: #subs-overage}

You're charged the non-discounted rate for any usage that exceeds your total Subscription amount.

## Can I pay the total spending commitment up-front or quarterly?
{: #subs-pay-schedule}

Currently, you can make monthly payments to your Subscription account. If you'd like to pay up-front or quarterly, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg).

## Can I spend more or less than my monthly commitment?  
{: #subs-spending}

Yes, what you spend monthly is up to you! You can spend any amount of the total commitment each month. 

## Can I cancel my Subscription account before the end of my term commitment?  
{: #subs-cancel-early}

Yes, you can cancel your account before your term expires, but note that the remainder of your total subscription credit, if any remains, will be forfeit at time of cancellation.  Additionally, any remaining payments on the subscription term will be due on the next invoice following the month service is cancelled.  For example, if you wish to cancel after 6 months of a 12 month term, all credits currently under the account will be lost on the date of cancellation, and an invoice for the last 6 unused months of the subscription will be issued to be paid, per contractual obligation to pay for the subscription term in full.  Also note that any data associated with the account following cancellation will be deleted, and cannot be recovered.

## What happens if I reach my spending commitment before my term ends?  
{: #subs-spend-before-term-end}

You're required to continue paying your monthly charges until the end of your term. To avoid generating overage charges, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/contact-us){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) for help with signing up for a new Subscription.
